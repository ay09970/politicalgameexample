A game dealing with an important issue today; dealing with Donald Trump creating a wall.
For my news game project, I decided to focus on the idea of Donald Trumps build a wall situation. I was going to do a game based on having to separate the Mexicans from the americans, and other races. But i came to a problem based on that there was some stuff within the coding that I couldn't do. I also didn’t want to portray the message that Mexicans are terrorists because that is not what i believe. I am now thinking of the same idea but instead of separating them you have to remove those who aren't legal immigrants. So I was going to have balls be different colors to represent the different races, and then the point of the game is to remove those who are not legal. This will also just be represented by a color. To make this game a little trickier I was going to have a time limit on the game. The person collecting the illegal immigrants will be represented by a police. 
I think this is an important issue today, especially because it’s something that is constantly increasing. It is also something that Donald Trump has been talking about since the presidential election. Immigration is a major thing in the United States. We have immigrants from all over the world. It isn’t necessarily something that needs to be stopped it is just something that needs to be solved. That they shouldn't necessarily receive the same benefits that American citizens and legal immigrants receive until they become one. 
I think for my project I will include a few if then statements, I will also be using the collision feature. I feel like this game will be closely associated with the assignment that we had to do for the midterm where we had to collect the stars, with a score board on top. Besides now theres a time limit and a completely different meaning. I know that this game has some of similarities of someone else’s within the class, but I hope there is enough differences to make the game a little different!
