A game dealing with an important issue today; dealing with Donald Trump creating a wall.
For my newsgame project, I decided to focus on the idea of Donald Trumps build a wall situation. I disagree with this idea, because I don’t belive that Mexicans are terrorists, or being terrorists. So for my game idea I’m going to have a wall built with ‘people’ moving and you have to drag them to which side of the wall they belong on. I was going to have the united states blow up or something happening but then that is now showing that they are terrorists. So my idea is now if you were to drag a Mexican to the U.S. it would create a garden or something. This idea is political because it has been an ongoing issue since the election. In order to create this game I’m going to have to create moving objects, and if then statements. I would also have to use different functions for the different people. I was debating on if I wanted to use mousePressed function or keyPressed function. I think that mousePressed would be easier for those playing the game. While keyPressed would make the game more difficult. I was also planning on changing the speed of how fast the people are coming out to make the game harder. The one question that I don’t know how to do is I don’t know how to drag something across the screen. Because if I wanted to use the mousePressed function you would have to drag the people to a specific side. Other than that I feel like I could easily make this. I was also planning on making the “people” represented by different colors, and then in the beginning before the game would start a set of directions would appear with a small key on which color represents whom. The screen would stay there until a button or something was pressed to have the game actually begin. If I can’t figure that out I was going to just have the directions on the screen for a total of 10 seconds or something along those lines.
